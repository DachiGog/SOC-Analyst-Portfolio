## 📚 Topics Covered

- 🔺 CTI Lifecycle:
  - Threat intel is obtained from a data-churning process that transforms raw data into contextualised and action-oriented insights geared towards triaging security incidents. The transformational process follows a six-phase cycle:
  - Direction
  - Collection
  - Processing
  - Analysis
  - Dissemination
  - Feedback

- 🔗 CTI Standards & Frameworks
  - Standards and frameworks provide structures to rationalise the distribution and use of threat intel across industries. They also allow for common terminology, which helps in collaboration and communication. Here, we briefly look at some essential standards and frameworks commonly used.
  - MITRE ATT&CK
  - TAXII [TAXII]((https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/taxii/intro)) 
  - STIX [STIX]((https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro))
  - Cyber Kill Chain
  - The Diamond Model
