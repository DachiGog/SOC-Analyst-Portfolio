## üìö Topics Covered

- MISP Introduction: Features & Terminologies:
  - MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) is an open-source threat information platform that facilitates the collection, storage and distribution of threat intelligence and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) related to malware, cyber attacks, financial fraud or any intelligence within a community of trusted members. 

- What does MISP support? 
  - IOC database: This allows for the storage of technical and non-technical information about malware samples, incidents, attackers and intelligence.
  - Automatic Correlation: Identification of relationships between attributes and indicators from malware, attack campaigns or analysis.
  - Data Sharing: This allows for sharing of information using different models of distributions and among different MISP instances.
  - Import & Export Features: This allows the import and export of events in different formats to integrate other systems such as NIDS, HIDS, and OpenIOC.
  - Event Graph: Showcases the relationships between objects and attributes identified from events.
  - API support: Supports integration with own systems to fetch and export events and intelligence.
 
- Using the System
  - Understanding why frameworks such as the UKC are important and helpful in establishing a good cybersecurity posture
  - Using the UKC to understand an attacker's motivation, methodologies and tactics
  - Understanding the various phases of the UKC
  - Discover that the UKC is a framework that is used to complement other frameworks such as MITRE.

- Feeds & Taxonomies
  - Feeds are resources that contain indicators that can be imported into MISP and provide attributed information about security events. These feeds provide analysts and organisations with continuously updated information on threats and adversaries and aid in their proactive defence against attacks.
