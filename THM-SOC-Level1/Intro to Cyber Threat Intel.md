# 🛡️ Intro to Cyber Threat Intel - TryHackMe Room Writeup
---
## 🧠 What I Learned

- Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and various frameworks used to share intelligence. As security analysts, CTI is vital for investigating and reporting against adversary attacks with organisational stakeholders and external communities.
---
## 📚 Topics Covered
  ###🔺 Pyramid Of Pain:
   - Understanding the Pyramid of Pain concept as a Threat Hunter, Incident Responder, or SOC Analyst is important.
  
### 🔗 Cyber Kill Chain:
  - learn about each phase of the Cyber Kill Chain Framework, the advantages and disadvantages of the traditional Cyber Kill Chain.

### ⛓️ Unified Kill Chain

- Understanding why frameworks such as the UKC are important and helpful in establishing a good cybersecurity posture
- Using the UKC to understand an attacker's motivation, methodologies and tactics
- Understanding the various phases of the UKC
- Discover that the UKC is a framework that is used to complement other frameworks such as MITRE.

## 💠 Dimond Model

- Identify the elements of an intrusion.
- Create a Diamond Model for events such as a breach, intrusion, attack, or incident.
- Analyze an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT).
- Introduction to MITRE

Focus on other projects/research that the US-based non-profit MITRE Corporation has created for the cybersecurity community, specifically:
ATT&CK ® ( A dversarial T actics, T echniques, and C ommon K nowledge) Framework
CAR ( C yber A nalytics R epository) Knowledge Base
ENGAGE (sorry, not a fancy acronym)
D3FEND ( D etection, D enial, and D isruption F ramework E mpowering N etwork D efense)
AEP ( A TT&CK E mulation P lans)
Mapping logs to MITRE ATT&CK (Initial Access, Execution)

##🔍 Scenario 1 Task
You are a security analyst who works in the aviation sector. Your organization is moving their infrastructure to the cloud. Your goal is to use the ATT&CK® Matrix to gather threat intelligence on APT groups who might target this particular sector and use techniques targeting your areas of concern. You are checking to see if there are any gaps in coverage. After selecting a group, look over the selected group's information and their tactics, techniques, etc.

### 🏛️ Pyramid Challenge - TryHackMe
## 🧩 Challenge Type
This was an investigative-style challenge that tested my ability to dig into provided data to find clues, decode information, and piece together a series of answers — similar to a CTF-style triage puzzle.

It required:

- Careful attention to detail
- Pattern recognition
- Logical thinking and patience

## 🔍 What I Did
- Explored the file closely for hidden information
- Used online tools and manual inspection to find embedded clues (metadata, steganography, filenames)
- Followed a trail of subtle hints and decoded messages to uncover the correct answers
- Each correct answer led to the next layer of the investigation

###🧠 What I Learned

- How to approach investigative challenges methodically
- How small clues (like filenames or metadata) can be critical in investigations
- Importance of documenting each step and hypothesis
- How real-world triage can involve creative problem-solving, not just tool usage

##💡 Skills Demonstrated
- Analytical thinking
- Attention to detail
- Basic steganography and OSINT-style investigation
- Persistence in multi-layered challenges
