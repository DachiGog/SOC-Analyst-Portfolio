## ðŸ§  What I Learned

### Capabilities and Description
- Traffic sniffing  - *It can intercept the traffic, sniff it, and collect and log packets that pass through the network.*
- Parsing PCAP files  - *It can parse pcap files and show the content of the packets in detail.*
- Protocol analysis  - *It can identify the used protocols from the parsed pcap file.*
- OS fingerprinting  - *It can identify the used OS by reading the pcap file. This feature strongly relies on [Satori](https://github.com/xnih/satori/) and [p0f](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/).*
- File Extraction  - *It can extract images, HTML files and emails from the parsed pcap file.*
