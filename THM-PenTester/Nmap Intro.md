# Nmap Introduction for Pentesters

Welcome to this introduction to **Nmap**, one of the most versatile and powerful tools in a pentester’s toolkit. This guide will help you understand the basics of Nmap, its common usage, and how to get started with it in penetration testing engagements.

## 🛠️ What is Nmap?

**Nmap** (Network Mapper) is an open-source tool designed for network discovery and security auditing. Originally created by Gordon Lyon (Fyodor), Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.

## 🎯 Why is Nmap Essential for Pentesters?

✅ Host discovery  
✅ Port scanning  
✅ Service and version detection  
✅ OS fingerprinting  
✅ Scriptable interaction with targets  
✅ Firewall and IDS evasion techniques

For pentesters, Nmap is invaluable for mapping a target’s attack surface and gaining crucial reconnaissance data.

## 🚀 Installing Nmap

- **Linux**:
- sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap

## 🔍 Basic Syntax
 - nmap [Scan Type(s)] [Options] {target specification}
## 🌐 Host Discovery (Ping Scanning)
- nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
## 🕳️ Port Scanning
- nmap target.com
## Full TCP scan (all 65535 ports)
- nmap -p- target.com
## Service version detection
- nmap -sV target.com
## 🧰 OS Detection
- nmap -O target.com
## 🔬 Running Nmap Scripts (NSE)
  The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) allows you to automate a wide range of tasks:
  Run default scripts
    - nmap -sC target.com
  Run scripts by category (e.g., vuln)
    - nmap --script vuln target.com
  Run a specific script
    - nmap --script http-title target.com
## ⚡ Combining Options for a Comprehensive Scan
    - nmap -A target.com
    -A: Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
## 🛡️ Evasion and Stealth
  Pentesters may need to bypass firewalls or avoid detection:
    -  Fragment packets:
    - `nmap -f target.com`
    - Decoy scanning:
    - `nmap -D decoy1,decoy2,target.com`
    - Timing options (speed and stealth tradeoff):
    - `nmap -T4 target.com`

| Service and version detection   | `nmap -sV target`           |
| OS detection                    | `nmap -O target`            |
| All scripts in default category | `nmap -sC target`           |
| Vulnerability scripts           | `nmap --script vuln target` |
