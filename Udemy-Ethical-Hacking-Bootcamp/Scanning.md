# 📡 Kali Linux Network Scanning - Nmap, Netdiscover & Evasion Techniques

## 🧠 What I Learned

This lab focused on using **Kali Linux** to perform network scanning against a **Metasploitable2 virtual machine**. 
I learned how to identify live hosts, discover open ports, determine the operating system, fingerprint service versions, and apply **evasion techniques** like using decoys and fragmented packets.

These are foundational skills for penetration testing and red team recon, as well as blue team defense and detection strategy.
